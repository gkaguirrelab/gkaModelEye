## quadric

This is a set of functions that work with quadric surfaces, rays, points, and their relations. Each sub-directory contains functions within the +quadric package, so that calls to all routines begin with `quadric.`.

The top-level function `rayTraceQuadrics.m` does not take the `quadric.` prefix.

A quadric surface may defined in several different ways. In these routines, I adopt the forms:

Implicit:
>       S(x,y,z) =  Ax^2 + Bx^2 + Cx^2 + 
>                     2Dxy + 2Exz + 2Fyz +
>                     2Gx + 2Hy + 2Iz + K == 0
>
> 	Note that the order of the cross-terms is xy, xz, yz

Matrix:
>      [A D E G;
>       D B F H;
>       E F C I;
>       G H I K]
       
Vector:
>      [A B C D E F G H I K]


The directories are:

- convert	- Convert quadrics between these forms, and from angles to rays
- geodetics	- Points and paths on ellipsoidal surfaces
- plot		- Plot quadric surfaces
- primitives	- Return primitive quadric surfaces (sphere, paraboloid, hyperboloid)
- properties	- Obtain the properties of a given quadric surface
- relations	- Spatial relationships between rays, surfaces, and points
- transform	- Affine (and other) transforms of surfaces and rays
