## eye

These routines define the model eye and scene geometry. The sub-directory "species" contains the functions that define elements of the model for the eye of a particular species.

The primary functions are:
- modelEyeParameters.m - Returns a structure that defines the properties of a model eye.
- createSceneGeometry.m - Returns a structure that defines the properties of the scene, including the eye.
