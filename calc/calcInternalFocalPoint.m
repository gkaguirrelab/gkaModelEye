function [focalPoint, blur] = calcInternalFocalPoint(opticalSystem,rayOriginDistance,rayHeight)
% Focal point for rays arising at the specified point on the optical axis
%
% Syntax:
%  focalPoint = calcInternalFocalPoint(opticalSystem,rayOriginDistance,rayHeight,cameraMedium)
%
% Description
%   This routine examines the behavior of a pair of diverging rays that
%   arise on the optical axis at the specified rayOriginDistance. These
%   rays intersect the plane of the front surface of the optical system,
%   and ultimately give rise to a pair of emergent rays. The closest point
%   of approach of these emergent rays is the internal focal point for this
%   near point.
%
% Inputs:
%   eye                   - Structure. SEE: modelEyeParameters
%   rayOriginDistance     - Scalar. The distance (in mm) of the origin of
%                           the ray from the corneal apex. Assumed to be
%                           500 mm if not defined.
%
% Outputs:
%   focalPoint            - 3x1 matrix with the Cartesian coordinates of
%                           point of closest approach of the two rays after
%                           emerging from the optical system. Ideally, this
%                           point is on the retina.
%   blur                  - The distance between the two rays at their
%                           point of closest approach. Ideally, this value
%                           is zero.
%
% Examples:
%{
    eye = modelEyeParameters();
    opticalSystem = assembleOpticalSystem(eye,...
        'surfaceSetName','mediumToRetina','cameraMedium','air');
    [focalPoint, blur] = calcInternalFocalPoint(opticalSystem,Inf);
