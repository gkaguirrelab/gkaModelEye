% Syntax:

%
% Description
%   This routine obtains the point of intersection of a pair of emergent
%   rays that are produced by a pair of diverging (or parallel) incident
%   rays. The incident rays arise from a particular field position (defined
%   w.r.t. the referenceCoord). If the rayOriginDistance is Inf, then the
%   rays are parallel. Otherwise, the rays diverge from a common origin
%   point at the specified distance. The point of closest approach of the
%   emergent rays is the internal focal point for the ray origin position.
%
% Inputs:
%   opticalSystem         - Either an eye structure (from which a
%                           "mediumToRetina" optical system in air will be
%                           derived), or an mx19 matrix, where m is set by
%                           the key value opticalSystemNumRows. Each row
%                           contains the values:
%                               [S side bb must n]
%                           where:
%                               S     - 1x10 quadric surface vector
%                               side  - Scalar taking the value -1 or 1
%                                       that defines which of the two
%                                       points of intersection on the
%                                       quadric should be used as the
%                                       refractive surface.
%                               bb    - 1x6 vector defining the bounding
%                                       box within which the refractive
%                                       surface is present.
%                               must  - Scalar taking the value of 0 or 1,
%                                       where 1 indicates that the ray must
%                                       intersect the surface. If the ray
%                                       misses a required surface, the
%                                       routine exits with nans for the
%                                       outputRay.
%                               n     - Refractive index of the surface.
%   fieldAngularPosition  - 2x1 vector that provides the coordinates of the
%                           origin of the nodal ray in [horizontal,
%                           vertical[ degrees with respect to the
%                           coordinate specified in referenceCoord.
%   rayOriginDistance     - Scalar. The distance (in mm) of the origin of
%                           the ray from the longitudinal axis origin.
%   angleReferenceCoord   - 3x1 vector that provides the coordinate from
%                           which the field angles are calculated. The
%                           incident node is a typical choice. If not
%                           defined, is set to [0;0;0], which is the origin
%                           coordinate on the longitudinal axis.
%   distanceReferenceCoord - 3x1 vector that provides the coordinate from
%                           which the rayOriginDistance is calculated. The
%                           The principal point is a typical choice. If not
%                           defined, is set to [0;0;0], which is the origin
%                           coordinate on the longitudinal axis.
%   rayIntersectionHeight - Scalar. The divergent rays will arrive at the
%                           corneal apex separated by 2x this value.
%   effectiveInfinity     - Scalar. Rays arising from this point or beyond
%                           will be treated as parallel.
%   cameraMedium          - String. The medium in which the eye is located.
%                           Defaults to 'air'.
%
% Outputs:
%   internalFocalPoint    - 3x1 matrix with the Cartesian coordinates of
%                           point of closest approach of the two rays after
%                           emerging from the optical system. Ideally, this
%                           point is on the retina.
%   raySeparationAtFocalPoint - The distance between the two rays at their
%                           point of closest approach. Ideally, this value
%                           is zero.
%   rayPath1, rayPath2    - 3xm matrix that provides the ray coordinates
%                           at each surface. The value for rayPath(1,:)
%                           is equal to initial position. If a surface is
%                           missed, then the coordinates for that surface
%                           will be nan.
