function P = calcPrincipalPoint(opticalSystem, rayOriginDistance, rayIntersectionHeight, cameraMedium)
% Returns the principal point for an opticalSystem
%
% Syntax:
%  P = calcPrincipalPoint(opticalSystem, rayOriginDistance, rayIntersectionHeight, cameraMedium)
%
% Description
%   For a ray that passes through an optical system, the incoming and
%   outgoing rays may be extrapolated until they intersect. The point of
%   intersection is termed the "equivalent refracting locus". A set of
%   parallel, incoming rays define a corresponding set of loci, which in
%   turn define the "principal surface". The point at which this surface
%   intersects the optical axis of the system is termed a principal point
%   (P).
%
%   An optical system has two principal points, which correspond to rays
%   originating from the right or left. The implementation of optical
%   systems and ray tracing in this code results in only one of these
%   ray tracing directions being available for a given opticalSystem
%   variable; only the valid solution is returned.
%
% Inputs:
%   opticalSystem         - Either an eye structure (from which a
%                           "mediumToRetina" optical system in air will be
%                           derived), or an mx19 matrix, where m is set by
%                           the key value opticalSystemNumRows. Each row
%                           contains the values:
%                               [S side bb must n]
%                           where:
%                               S     - 1x10 quadric surface vector
%                               side  - Scalar taking the value -1 or 1
%                                       that defines which of the two
%                                       points of intersection on the
%                                       quadric should be used as the
%                                       refractive surface.
%                               bb    - 1x6 vector defining the bounding
%                                       box within which the refractive
%                                       surface is present.
%                               must  - Scalar taking the value of 0 or 1,
%                                       where 1 indicates that the ray must
%                                       intersect the surface. If the ray
%                                       misses a required surface, the
%                                       routine exits with nans for the
%                                       outputRay.
%                               n     - Refractive index of the surface.
%   rayOriginDistance     - Scalar. The distance (in mm) of the origin of
%                           the ray from the corneal apex. Assumed to be
%                           1500 mm if not defined.
%   rayIntersectionHeight - Scalar. The distance in the vertical direction
%                           from the optical axis of the ray origin.
%   cameraMedium          - String. The medium in which the eye is located.
%                           Defaults to 'air'.
%
% Outputs:
%   P                     - 3x1 matrix. The location of the principal
%                           point.

    % Display a lens and it's principal point
    systemDirection = 'cameraToEye';
    opticalSystem = addSpectacleLens([],-10,'systemDirection',systemDirection);
    % Plot this

    P2 = calcPrincipalPoint(sceneGeometry.refraction.retinaToMedium.opticalSystem);
    plotModelEyeSchematic(sceneGeometry);
