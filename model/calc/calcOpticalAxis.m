function [opticalAxisRay,errors] = calcOpticalAxis(opticalSystem,rayOriginDistance,cameraMedium)
% Returns the optical axis for an opticalSystem

% Syntax:

%
% Description
%   The optical axis of a system is the ray that enters and exits the
%   optical system along the same, straight line. For a system of simple
%   spherical lenses, this corresponds to the line that passes through the
%   centers of curvature of the surfaces. When these surfaces are centered
%   on the longitudinal axis, then the longitudinal and optical axes are
%   equivalent. As developed by Harris (2010), more complicated optical
%   systems are likely to have a single optical axis, and simple optical
%   systems may have zero or an infinity of such rays:

%       systems." Optometry and Vision Science 86.5 (2009): 537-541.
%
%   For an eye with decententered elements, the optical axis diverges
%   somewhat from the longitudinal axis.
%
% Inputs:
%   opticalSystem         - Either an eye structure (from which a
%                           "mediumToRetina" optical system in air will be
%                           derived), or an mx19 matrix, where m is set by
%                           the key value opticalSystemNumRows. Each row
%                           contains the values:
%                               [S side bb must n]
%                           where:
%                               S     - 1x10 quadric surface vector
%                               side  - Scalar taking the value -1 or 1
%                                       that defines which of the two
%                                       points of intersection on the
%                                       quadric should be used as the
%                                       refractive surface.
%                               bb    - 1x6 vector defining the bounding
%                                       box within which the refractive
%                                       surface is present.
%                               must  - Scalar taking the value of 0 or 1,
%                                       where 1 indicates that the ray must
%                                       intersect the surface. If the ray
%                                       misses a required surface, the
%                                       routine exits with nans for the
%                                       outputRay.
%                               n     - Refractive index of the surface.
%   rayOriginDistance     - Scalar. The distance (in mm) of the origin of
%                           the ray from origin of the longitudinal axis.
%                           Assumed to be 1500 mm if not defined.
%
% Outputs:
%   opticalAxisRay        - 3x2 matrix that is the optical axis ray.
%   errors                - 1x1 matrix with the follow error values:
%                             - The L2 norm of the distance between ray,
%                               and the projected position of the output ray
