function imagePoints = applyRadialLensDistortion(imagePointsPreDistortion,sceneGeometry)
% Apply the effects of lens distortion to points in the image plane
%
% Syntax:
%  imagePoints = applyRadialLensDistortion(imagePointsPreDistortion,sceneGeometry)
%
% Description:
%   This step introduces "pincushion" (or "barrel") distortion produced by
%   the lens. The x and y distortion equations are in the normalized image
%   coordinates. Thus, the origin is at the sensor optical center (aka
%   principal point), and the coordinates are in world units. To apply this
%   distortion to our image coordinate points, we subtract the optical
%   center, and then divide by fx and fy from the intrinsic matrix.
%
% Inputs:
%   imagePointsPreDistortion - nx2 vector. Points in image coordinates.
%   sceneGeometry         - Structure. SEE: createSceneGeometry
%
% Outputs:
%   imagePoints           - nx2 vector. Points in image coordinates.
