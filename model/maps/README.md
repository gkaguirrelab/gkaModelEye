## maps

Functions that create maps of different classes of cell density across the retinal surface 

Information and notes common to both data directories:

The subject demographic tables from the 1990 Curcio papers identify subjects using the labels H1, H2, etc, while the raw data sheets provided by Curcio identify subjects by ID numbers (e.g., 29986).

I contacted Christine by email on November 13, 2017. Her response on January 6, 2018 confirms that:

H5 = 29986
H4 = 44985. Has both RGC and cone data, but from the left and right eyes. Christine notes that the 1990 GC paper states "In the within-individual comparison of cone and ganglion cell distributions, the retinas H4L (cones) and H4R (ganglion cells) were considered to have originated from the same eye."
