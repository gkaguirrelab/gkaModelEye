function Rr = refractRay(R,N,nRel)
% Returns a refracted ray given an incident ray, surface normal, and index 
%
% Syntax:
%  Rr = quadric.refractRay(R,N,nRel)
%
% Description:
%   Snell's Law of optical refraction may be expressed in three-dimensions
%   in matrix form. This routine provides the refracted ray after an
%   incident ray encounters a surface with a given surface normal, and
%   possesing a given relative index of refraction. If the ray is found to
%   experience total internal reflection, the routine returns nans for the
%   refracted ray.
%
%   This approach to optical systems is described in:
%
%       Langenbucher, Achim, et al. "Ray tracing through a schematic eye
%       containing second-order (quadric) surfaces using 4x4 matrix
%       notation." Ophthalmic and Physiological Optics 26.2 (2006):
%       180-188.
%
% Inputs:
%   R                     - 3x2 matrix that specifies the incident ray as 
%                           a vector of the form [p; u], corresponding to
%                               R = p + t*u
%                           where p is vector origin, u is the direction
%                           expressed as a unit step, and t is unity for a
%                           unit vector.
%   N                     - 3x2 matrix that specifies the surface normal as 
%                           a vector of the form [p; u], corresponding to
%                               N = p + t*u
%                           where p is vector origin, u is the direction
%                           expressed as a unit step, and t is unity for a
%                           unit vector.
%   nRel                  - The relative index of refraction n / n', where
%                           n is the index of refraction of the medium of
%                           the incident ray, and n' is the index of
%                           refraction of the medium of the surface that
%                           the ray has intersected.
%
% Outputs:
%   Rr                    - 3x2 matrix that specifies the refracted ray as 
%                           a vector of the form [p; u], corresponding to
%                               Rr = p + t*u
%                           where p is vector origin, u is the direction
%                           expressed as a unit step, and t is unity for a
%                           unit vector.

% Pre-allocate the output variable

% Clear the nan cases

% Obtain the direction vector of the incident ray

% Obtain the direction vector of the surface normal

% Place the surface intersection point as the origin of the refracted ray
Rr(:,1) = N(:,1);

% Code to generate the 3D expression of Snell's Law

% Calculate the direction vector of the refracted ray. This equation is
% taken from: http://www.starkeffects.com/snells-law-vector.shtml

% Compute the full expression in parts to save on computations
Cqu = cross(q,u);
rootTerm = 1-(nRel^2)*dot(Cqu,Cqu);

% Test if the component to be rooted is negative. If so, this reflects
% total internal reflection, and we exit the function with nans for the
% refracted ray.
