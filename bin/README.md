## bin

This directory holds compiled MEX function versions of `findPupilRay` and `findGlintRay`.

If you need to compile the MEX function for your system, issue the command `compileInverseRayTrace` in the MATLAB console.

The compiled function is placed by default in the directory that contains `compileInverseRayTrace`, which should be:
```
gkaModelEye/bin
```

Pre-compiled mex files are provided for some systems:

findPupilRayMex.mexmaci64	--	Mac OSX, MATLAB2017a and later
