## ellipse

Routines for fitting ellipses. Several of these functions are taken from the "quadFit" MATLAB central toolbox created by:

> Levente Hunyadi, "Estimation methods in the errors-in-variables context", PhD dissertation, submitted in 2013 to the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. 

The original routines may be found here:

The functions taken from the quadFit toolbox are stored within the sub-directory `hunyadi`.

Many of these routines have been slightly modified to speed execution and support code compilation.
